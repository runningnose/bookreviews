⭐⭐⭐☆☆

Probably the first of many book reviews.

Well, my dad made me read a bunch of books over this winter break, so naturally I picked the slimmest one. And well, it was The Prince, by Machiavelli. Clocking in at almost 80 pages, it beat out the other books in terms of brevity by a lot. In a way though, that book was really long, both in terms of the small print crammed on to each page and also in the way that the unfamiliar archaic language, on top of all the historical references that force you to reread and reread again to truly understand it. This is the classic book on how to be the most effective, renowned leader of a country.

Unfortunately for you and I, some of the advice is not very applicable. Unless you are the high ranking official in some nation advice on how to quell rebellions, or how to deal with the church. The book does have its occasional gems of lines, like telling how a leader should appear to their underlings, or how to pick allies, but they are few and far between long lines about how great Alexander the 6th was, or how dumb the French were when they attacked Italy. Sparknotes says that the “prose is simple and it’s logic straightforward”, but with all those things, I wouldn’t be so inclined to agree.

The book that has the largest parallels with this book is probably Sun Tzu’s acclaimed war manual, The Art of War.  Some important bits that are definitely worth reading, but placed among war tactics that are both dated and not very relevant to readers. I probably would have placed it in a higher viewpoint, had it been updated so that it wasn’t so Italy and time period specific, but since I can only review what I read, I rated the book three out five stars.
